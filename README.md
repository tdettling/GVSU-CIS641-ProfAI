# Prof AI
ProfAI is a web applicatiion that utalizes generative AI to create curated dynamic content for faculty at Grand Valley State University. ProfAI will first request faculty members to generate a realistic avatar of themselves. After an avatar has been created, the proposed application will then generate a script based on the faculty member's topic of choosing. Upon receiving approval of the script from the faculty member, the web application will then generate a video of the avatar speaking the approved script, alongside a slideshow in a downloadable 2-5 minute video. Faculty members may then upload the video in whichever way they would like to deploy to students. After the initial launch of the project, IT Innovation and Research will conduct student interviews with the students that have seen the video of their faculty member to determine the value and authenticity of the content.
