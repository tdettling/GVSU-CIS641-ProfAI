# Project - System Request - Academic Instructor Video Generative AI Web App

## Project Sponsor
Erik Fredericks, Professor, College of Computing

## Business Need 
This project has been initiated to streamline content creation for faculty
members by generating dedicated avatars, scripts and academic videos at Grand Valley State
University.

## Business Requirements
* Avatar model generation
* Script generation and script adjustments
* Generate a downloadable short video using a real-life avatar and script

## Business Value
We expect this system to streamline content creation for faculty members which will allow more
time for faculty members to focus on the quality of lectures, and not the technical details.
Implementation of this system is also expected to enhance student interest and performance.
This system is set to expand the accessibility of content to students due to the flexibility in
preferences and student schedules.


## Special Issues or Constraints
* Extra time will need to be allocated for training developers, as all of the developers on
this project are not familiar with web development.
* Once this system enters its preparations for becoming market ready, additional security
measures will need to be implemented to safely protect content creatorâ€™s identities.
