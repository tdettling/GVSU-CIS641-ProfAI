# Introduction
Students have varying preferences for learning, requiring flexible, dynamic content to suit their needs. Studies show that longer lectures with minimal engagement from students leads to poor retention and interest from students [source here fixme]. Additionally, instructors are struggling to produce meaningful content for students due to the technical requirements of content creation. With these motivating factors in mind, GVSU IT Innovation and Research is proposing ProfAI, a dynamic generative AI content creation web application.



ProfAI will first allow faculty members to generate a realistic avatar of themselves. After an avatar has been created, the proposed application will then generate a script on the faculty member's topic of choosing. Upon receiving approval of the script form the faculty member, the application will then generate a video of the avatar speaking the approved script, alongside a slideshow in a downloadable 2-5 minute video. After the initial launch of the project, IT Innovation and Research will conduct student interviews with the students that have seen the video of their faculty member to determine the value and authenticity of the content.



# Anticipated Technologies

- Mongo Compass for database - use mongo now, upgrade to Azure expected in 2025 by IT
- Google Slidesd API for video slide geenration
- ChatGPT Assistent API for script generation
- HeyGen API for secure avatar creation AND video generatin
- Github for repo
- Trello for PM
- eleven labs for voice geeration

We predict the use of several technologies for this project. At this time, we are planning to keep user data stored and secured with MongoDB. We are looking into ChatGPT'S Assistant API for script generation. Next, we plan to use ElevenLabs(link phrase) for voice generation. Although we have not finalized this yet, we are planning to use either SlidesSpeak (link) or Magic slides (link) for slideshow generation based on the generated script. We plan to use HeyGen (see [HeyGen's][webise.com] website for more information) for secure avatar generation and video generation.


We plan to use GitHub to keep track of and maintain our web app. We plan to use Trello as a project management tool.

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

This project currently includes a staff member form IT Innovation and Research, an undergraduate student form GVSU, and myself. We plan to use an Agile development methodology because of the flexibility it offers, and the focus on working software. As a slight deviation from traditional agile methodologies, our team plans to create a workflow for changing requirements so that we can sustain our timeline for the semester (rather than the traditional "embracing" of changing requirements).


The staff member in IT Innovation and Research is serving as the project manager. He will be running weekly check-in both individually and as a team for this project, ensuring direct and consistent communication. The undergraduate student i'll be serving primarily as a front-end developer. I will be serving as both a product manager (requirements, visuals, planning, etc.) and as a backend developer. I have also initiated weekly meetings with the undergraduate student to ensure regular communication between those who are contributing code.


# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

- critical requirements & USER STORIES
- user stories
- inital app/env setup
- first prototype
- Mid-sprint check-in
- final prottype before first launch (deliverbale for class)

We anticipate there being several milestones for this project. First, we plan to finish creating our mission critical high-level requirements and finalize our user stories near xdate. This will allow us to move forward with the next stage of our development process. Our next major milestone will be to finalize our technical specifications for this project, which will outline what technologies will be implemented. Moving forward, we will then hope to plan a sprint with completion around xdate for some of our critical requirements. Because this will be the first sprint, I consider this a milestone. Several sprints will be planned for the next few weeks, with a mid-sprint check-in planned near xdate. As this is a larger scale project, having a mid-sprint check-in can be vital for developer feedback. Finally, we hope to reach a working prototype ready for a trial launch in late November for iT Innovation and Research. THi will give us time to hear formal feedback from both iT and from our selected faculty who choose to use this tool.

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)

One of the major challenges we foresee is the lack of knowledge about web development from the developers. Although I am familiar with languages like Julia, Python, and Java, I have never done web development. Our other developer has been learning web development for the last month, so the technical abilities of our team in terms of web development is low. However, there are available resources online for developers to learn web development.  Since the beginning of the semester, I have been practicing and watching tutorials to prepare for this challenge.


I believe that scope creep will also be a challenge - this is the type of project that could get far too large in requirements for a semester long class. Although expectations have been communicated between myself and the project manager, we need to make sure to be extra cautious that new requirements are not thrown in at the last minute, and that we are firm about the size and scope of this implementation. Our hope is that our weekly meetings and consistent communication between our team members will alleviate some of this challenge. We also plan to come up with a process for approving/declining changing requirements so that the critical requirements don't get too large.
