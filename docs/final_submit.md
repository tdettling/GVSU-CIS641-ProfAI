# Change management plan
This section details the change management plan for ProfAI.


### Sponsor
Erik Fredericks, Professor, College of Computing, Grand Valley State University


### Change Agent
Information Technology Innovation and Research, Information Technology, Grand Valley State University


### Potential Adopters
* Faculty Members
* IT Staff Members


### Plan

#### Revising Management Policies
We plan to evaluate IT's current policies to identify if any policies conflict with our product. With the pending launch of any new AI policies or procedures, we will assess if any action needs to be taken for our product. Proposed changes will be submitted as a formal request to IT Innovation and Research. Any proposed changes to our system will be reviewed by both IT Innovation and Research, and IT Security. If needed, approvals may need to be revised and approved again. This review is intended to resolve any integration issues, policy conflicts, and user experience pain points. All changes will be compatible with GVSU systems.


#### Assessing the Cost and Benefits
For any requested changes, IT Innovation and Research will evaluate the costs associated, such as software licensing, working hours and development time, etc. Benefits and downsides of proposed changes will also be considered. In the assessment, any potential risks will be identified and judged for approval/denial.


#### Motivating Adoption
Any approved implemented change will be announced by IT Innovation and Research. Test groups, motivated by free beta testing, will be asked to verify that the change was successful. Surveys will be sent to early testers to request feedback.


#### Training
Training content will be provided to faculty who are registered on the application. Appropriate training will also be given to staff members supporting the application upon any approved and implemented change. Any major change to this application will include a series of training articles (Knowledge Base Articles) to enhance community member understanding.
